# STUMGE 
STUMGE is a micro engine for HTML5 games. It focuses on bringing an old school game development experience to the web, 
and in keeping the size of both the library and the games small.

## DONEs
* Sprites with rotation and flipping.
* Screen management
* Keyboard management (KeyPressed, KeyPress)
* Efficient handling of the canvas with regular 60 FPS animation
* On-screen font
* On-screen palette

## TODOs
A tutorial is on the making. So far, there is JSDoc documentation and a couple of examples on the examples folder. There 
is also an example game, [EFFIN' SNEK](https://games.studiosi.es/efs) that can be considered a small example of what can
be done with the library.

I appreciate any kind of collaboration, so bug reports and pull requests are more than welcome!
